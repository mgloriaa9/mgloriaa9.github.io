      <h5 class='m-t-2 m-b-0 f-s-16'>Vancouver Coastal Health</h5>
      <h5 class='m-t-2 m-b-0'>Dear Vancouver Coastal Health Employers,</h5>
      <p class='m-t-2 m-b-0 f-s-13'>I am applying for the position of an Employed Student Nurse (ESN) for the health authority of Vancouver Coastal Health
        in order to strengthen my nursing characteristics and to fulfill my career objective. I believe that by acquiring
        an ESN position at Vancouver Coastal Health will allow me to enhance my abilities to care for clients safely, efficiently
        and with empathy by putting honesty, compassion and evidence-based best practice as the leading values of my nursing
        practice.
      </p>
      <p class='m-t-2 m-b-0 f-s-13'>I am currently enrolled in Langaraâ€™s Bachelor of Science in Nursing program and hope to continue my education. In my
        two years in the nursing program, I am able to demonstrate my great work ethic in school and in clinical practice
        as represented by my GPA of greater than 3.6. Furthermore, I have used my eager and enthusiastic personal traits
        to obtain any opportunities that can enhance my nursing knowledge, skills and professional development by attending
        conferences such as the CNSA Western Prairie Regional Conference and the Resilience: The Biology of Stress & The
        Science of Hope workshop. Other assets I believe would be important in this position is my experience as a co-chair
        for the Langara CRNBC student group. This group has given me the opportunity to become a confident speaker of my
        thoughts and ideas of possible changes that should occur in the work-field in order to improve nursing practice.</p>
      <p class='m-t-2 m-b-0 f-s-13'>I understand that the position as an Employed Student Nurse may have its challenges, however, I feel that my confidence
        in my nursing skills, compassionate attitude, great work ethic and the knowledge acquired through my nursing education
        will add a positive contribution to the position of an Employed Student Nurse. I look forward to the opportunity
        to discuss how I would contribute to the continued success of the Vancouver Coastal Health Authority.</p>
      <h5 class='m-t-2 m-b-0'>Sincerely yours,</h5>        
      <h5 class='m-t-2 m-b-0'>Mary Mikaella Gloria, SN</h5>
